This script automates the process of gathering data from a prebuilt model in Quickfield.
Running conditions: 
-Quickfield must be on at least half of the screen (left side). 
-The inputs are offered in a text file
-The output word file must remain closed while the script is running
-You cannot not touch your mouse while the script is running :(
